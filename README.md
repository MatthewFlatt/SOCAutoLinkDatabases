# SOCAutoLinkDatabases
Scripts for customers to automatically link databases for many users.

Currently works only for TFS and the Shared database model.

Needs to be run on the SSMS client machine, logged in with the user, with SQL Source Control installed.

Will overwrite any existing config so existing linked databases will be lost.
